I made this project back in the Winter of 2013 as a final project for school.

To understand the context behind the code:
* I was in the process of understanding C++11
* I was still learning about C++ in general
* I was stuck with Visual Studio 2010
* I had just begun learning about design patterns(such as a Factory)
* I had close to no experience in video games development
* This was done with SFML 2.0 RC

Now that is said, you may enjoy(or not) the code behind this bomberman recreation.

Features:
* 3 AI(Aggressive, Defensive, Random)
* Map Editor
* Profile Creation(with custom key mapping)

Known Bugs:
* If an AI has no possibility of escape, will go in an infinite loop and the game will stop responding
* If a map has no borders, it will crash
* The AIs and player can walk over bombs

What does the repo comes with:
* A CMakeLists.txt to generate a solution
* Requires SFML 2.5
* Requires lib cereal
